# EDA-PROJECT-1-Hotel-Booking-Analysis

The analysis revealed several key insights:

1) City hotels tend to have a higher volume of bookings compared to resort hotels, possibly due to their lower cost and proximity to transportation hubs like railway stations and airports. Additionally, resort hotels may be perceived as more expensive or located farther away.

2) Approximately 27% of bookings were cancelled, indicating a significant rate of reservation changes. Only 3.9% of guests were repeat visitors.

3) Bookings for city hotels peak from January to June before declining.

4) The majority of guests originated from Portugal.

5) Room type 'A' emerged as the most preferred choice among guests.
